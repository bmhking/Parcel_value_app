This app requires `Shiny` to run.  
Note that the default Shiny host server can only allow 1GB of RAM, while this app requires at least 2GB. Therefore, the default version of this app can only show the results of the cities of Calrsbad and Chula Vista and the unicorpoated community of Rancho Santa Fe.  
For the whole county's data, unzip `parcel_value_sdcounty.7z`, which will reveal the csv that has data for all parcels in the county and replace the existing file in `/data` with the unzipped file.
